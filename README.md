## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Setting up the Environment

If you're using GitHub Codespaces, open the terminal inside the Codespace.  
If you're running locally, make sure [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is installed.

Create and activate the conda environment using the provided environment file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate BISB211203
```
> Note for Codespaces users: If this is your first time using conda in the terminal, run conda init and restart the terminal before activating the environment.

### 2. Launching JupyterLab
Once the environment is active, start JupyterLab with:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the interactive Jupyter environment where you can follow the course materials for each session:
