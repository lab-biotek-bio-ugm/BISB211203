## 🧪 How to Run the Practice Sessions
In the final part of the course, we include hands-on practice sessions delivered as interactive Jupyter Notebooks. You can run the materials directly on `GitHub Codespaces` or on your own computer. You will need to create a GitHub account and install VS Code in your computer first. 

Follow the instructions below to get started:

### 🔧 Run on GitHub Codespaces and Open in VS Code
`GitHub Codespaces` allows you to run things in the cloud with VS code as the interface.

**Steps:**

1. Go to the course repository:
[https://github.com/lab-biotek-bio-ugm/BISB211203](https://github.com/lab-biotek-bio-ugm/BISB211203)

2. Click the green `“Code”` button, then choose `“Open with Codespaces”` → `“New codespace”`.

3. Open a new tab and open [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). Find your Virtual Machine, at the bottom and click the three dots `"..."` on the right of the VM, then load the codespace in Visual Studio.

4. After the Codespace loads, open the terminal and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    conda init
    ```

5. It will ask you to close and reopen the terminal. You can do this by clicking the `+` button on the right top corner of the terminal.

6. Create the environment by:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

7. Activate the environment by:

    ```bash
    conda activate BISB211203
    ```

7. Launch JupyterLab by running:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

8. The JupyterLab interface will launch in your browser. If it does not open automatically, copy the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., starting with `http://127.0.0.1:8888`) and paste it into your browser.

9. You can now open the notebooks (e.g., `03_T-test.ipynb`) and start the exercises.
