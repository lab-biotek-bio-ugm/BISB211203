🧪 How to Run the Practice Sessions
Welcome to BISB211203 – Biostatistics for Life Sciences. This course includes hands-on practice sessions delivered as interactive Jupyter Notebooks. You can run the materials directly on GitHub Codespaces or on your own computer. Follow the instructions below to get started:

🔧 Option 1: Run on GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
GitHub Codespaces allows you to run everything in your browser — no need to install anything on your computer.

Steps:
Go to the course repository:
https://github.com/lab-biotek-bio-ugm/BISB211203

Click the green “Code” button, then choose “Open with Codespaces” → “New codespace”.

After the Codespace loads, open the terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
conda init
# Then close and reopen the terminal
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate BISB211203
jupyter lab
```

The JupyterLab interface will launch in your browser. You can now open the notebooks (e.g., 03_T-test.ipynb) and start the exercises.
