# Chi-square Test
## What is the Chi-Square Test?
The Chi-Square Test of Independence helps us answer:

- Is there a relationship between two categorical variables?
- Or are they independent?

It compares the observed frequencies (what we actually see) to the expected frequencies (what we would expect if the variables were not related).


```R
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggthemes)
```

## 📦 Example: Penguins on Islands
Let's take a look at our penguin dataset again.
How are the penguins distributed in the three islands?

</div>

### Observed Frequencies (O)


```R
df <- na.omit(penguins)

# Create observed contingency table
penguin_table <- table(df$species, df$island)
as.data.frame.matrix(penguin_table)
```

It seems that there are some preferences of the penguins to live in a certain island? Don't you think so?

Let's test this question:
> **Is species distribution associated with the islands?**

### Expected Frequencies (E)
If there's no association, the penguins would be distributed proportionally in each island.

We can use this formula to calculate the expected frequency in each island.

$E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{row total}_i) \times (\text{column total}_j)}{\text{grand total}}$

So the Expected Table is:


```R
# Get totals
row_totals <- rowSums(penguin_table)
col_totals <- colSums(penguin_table)
grand_total <- sum(penguin_table)

# Manually compute expected frequency matrix
expected_matrix <- outer(row_totals, col_totals, FUN = function(r, c) (r * c) / grand_total)

# Round to nearest integer
expected_matrix <- round(expected_matrix)

# Assign row and column names
rownames(expected_matrix) <- rownames(penguin_table)
colnames(expected_matrix) <- colnames(penguin_table)

# View expected frequencies
expected_matrix
```

Let's compare the observed and expected values side by side:


```R
# Extract observed and expected
observed <- as.numeric(penguin_table)
expected <- as.numeric(expected_matrix)

# Combine into a data frame with labels
species <- rep(rownames(penguin_table), times = ncol(penguin_table))
island <- rep(colnames(penguin_table), each = nrow(penguin_table))

observation_table <- data.frame(
  Species = species,
  Island = island,
  Observed = observed,
  Expected = round(expected, 2)
)

observation_table
```

## Calculating the Chi-square

The Chi-Square test statistic tells us **how different** the observed data is from what we would expect under the assumption that the two categorical variables are independent.

We use the following formula:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$

Where:

- $( O )$ = observed frequency (what we actually counted)
- $( E )$ = expected frequency (what we would expect if there were no association)
- $( \chi^2 )$ = the total test statistic, measuring the overall difference between observed and expected

---

### 🔍 How does it work?

We go through each cell of the contingency table and compute:

$$
\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$

This value will be:
- **Close to 0** if observed and expected are similar
- **Larger** when there's a big difference between the two

Then we **sum up** all of these values from every cell to get the total Chi-Square statistic.

---

### 🎯 What does it tell us?

If the resulting $( \chi^2 )$ value is **large enough**, it means the differences between observed and expected are **too big to be due to random chance**.  
This suggests that the two variables (like *species* and *island*) are **likely associated**.

---

### 📊 Visualize O vs E

To help you better understand where the differences come from, you can make a bar plot comparing observed vs expected frequencies:



```R
ggplot(observation_table, aes(x = Island, fill = Species)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Observed), stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Expected), shape = 4, size = 3,
             position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  labs(title = "Observed vs Expected Counts",
       y = "Frequency", caption = "X marks expected values") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Let's Calculate the Chi-Square value

Let's go through each cell of the contingency table and compute:

$$
\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$

And at the end, we will create a sum of all the component values


```R
# Calculate chi-square components: (O - E)^2 / E
component <- (observed - expected)^2 / expected

# Add to the data frame (round if desired)
observation_table$Component <- round(component, 2)

# View the updated table
observation_table

# Total chi-square statistic
cat("Total χ² =", round(sum(component), 2), "\n")
```

### Degrees of Freedom

So, we got the χ² values, but how do we interpret it? Before we can interpret the value, first we need to calculate the degree of freedom first.

The degrees of freedom (df) for a Chi-Square test in a contingency table is calculated as:

$$
df = (\text{\#rows} - 1) \times (\text{\#columns} - 1)
$$

In our case, there are 3 species (rows) and 3 islands (columns):

$$
df = (3 - 1)(3 - 1) = 2 \times 2 = 4
$$

We can use the df to find the critical value from a Chi-Square distribution table at a significance level of 0.05.



```R
# Parameters
df_val <- 4
alpha <- 0.05

# Critical value (right-tail threshold)
critical_value <- qchisq(p = 1 - alpha, df = df_val)

# Generate x and y for chi-square density curve
x <- seq(0, critical_value + 10, length.out = 500)
y <- dchisq(x, df = df_val)

# Plot the Chi-Square distribution
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "#2171B5",
     ylab = "Density", xlab = expression(chi^2),
     main = bquote("Chi-Square Distribution (df = " ~ .(df_val) ~ ")"))

# Add vertical line at critical value
abline(v = critical_value, col = "#c02728", lwd = 2, lty = 2)

# Shade the rejection region (right tail)
x_shade <- seq(critical_value, max(x), length.out = 100)
y_shade <- dchisq(x_shade, df = df_val)
polygon(c(critical_value, x_shade, max(x_shade)),
        c(0, y_shade, 0),
        col = "#FF666680", border = NA)

# Annotate the plot
text(critical_value + 1.5, max(y)*0.5,
     paste0("Critical value (0.05) = ", round(critical_value, 2)),
     col = "#c02728")

```

### Interpretation

Now we compare the calculated Chi-Square statistic to the critical value from a Chi-Square distribution table at a significance level of 0.05.

If:

- $( \chi^2 = 284.59 )$
- $( df = 4 )$
- Critical value at $( \alpha = 0.05 )$ is **9.49**

Then:

$$
284.59 > 9.49
$$

So we **reject the null hypothesis**.

---

✅ **Conclusion**:  
- There is a **statistically significant relationship** between penguin species and the islands where they are found.  
- The distribution is **not uniform** and likely reflects ecological or behavioral preferences.

## Running chi-square test in R

R has a neat chi-square package, so we can directly use the library instead of calculating it manually:


```R
# Run the chi-square test
chi <- chisq.test(penguin_table)

chi
```

Let us also visualize the result:


```R
# Extract test statistic and df
chi_stat <- chi$statistic
df_val <- chi$parameter

# Create x values for chi-square density
x <- seq(0, chi_stat + 20, length.out = 500)
y <- dchisq(x, df = df_val)

# Plot
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "#2171B5",
     ylab = "Density", xlab = expression(chi^2),
     main = paste("Chi-Square Distribution (df =", df_val, ")"))

# Add vertical line at test statistic
abline(v = chi_stat, col = "#c02728", lwd = 2, lty = 2)

# Annotate
text(chi_stat + 2, max(y)*0.8,
     labels = paste0("X² = ", round(chi_stat, 2)),
     col = "#c02728")
```
