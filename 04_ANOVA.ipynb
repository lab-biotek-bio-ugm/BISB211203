    "## What is ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANOVA** stands for **Analysis of Variance**. It‚Äôs a statistical method used to find out whether there are significant differences between the **means of two or more groups**. In other words, it helps us answer the question: *Are the group averages different from each other, or are any differences just due to random chance?*\n",
    "\n",
    "## When do we use ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you only have **2 groups**, you can use a **t-test** to compare them.\n",
    "- If you have **3 or more groups**, **ANOVA** is the better tool to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of ANOVA depending on the study design (like one-way, two-way, or repeated measures).  \n",
    "In this course, we will focus on the **one-way ANOVA**, which is the simplest version. It is called ‚Äúone-way‚Äù because we are looking at the effect of **one factor** or independent variable\n",
