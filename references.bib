  abstract     = {The authors have investigated the effects of parental smoking
                  patterns on the pulmonary function of children in East Boston,
                  Massachusetts. A crude inverse dose-response relationship was
                  observed between the level of FEF25--75\% predicted of
                  children who never smoked and the number of smoking parents in
                  the household. Compared to children with two non-smoking
                  parents, the level of FEF25--75\% predicted was 0.156 and
                  0.355 standard deviation units lower for children with one and
                  two currently smoking parents, respectively. An additional
                  decline in level of FEF25--75\% predicted was observed for
                  children who themselves had smoked. Smoking children with two
                  smoking parents had an average FEF25--75\% predicted level
                  which was 0.355 standard deviation units lower than
                  non-smoking children with two smoking parents. These data not
                  only confirm that cigarette smoking by young children and
                  teenagers has direct measurable effects on their pulmonary
                  function, but also show that cigarette smoking by parents has
                  a measurable effect on the pulmonary function of their
                  children which is independent of any direct use of cigarettes
                  by the children.},
